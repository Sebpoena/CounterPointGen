# CounterPointGen
A short project, with the first goal of a working counterpoint solver, and the following goal of unlimited absurd or advanced mutations of counterpoint as a concept.
What do I mean by this? 
-> Well I want to start with the most basic of counterpoint rules 
-> following this, I want to add rules about the intervals between notes in the solution, to see if I can prioritise a more melodic line
-> following this, I intend on adding an ability to prompt the changing of scales throughout the bassline
-> following this, I want to try it out with different scales, such as modal scale, or the octatonic scale, whole tone scale, or messians modes of limited modulation 
-> following this I want to take all the rules of counterpoint and slowly twist and mutate them however I want, perverting the rules to absurd extremes 
-> following this I want to take it into microtonal territories, adding intervals with quartertones in them, and forcing the solver to do my evil bidding

In the end, I want to have many different renditions of the solver, each capable of creating something that adheres to a ruleset I devise. I like the idea that this is
more of an art project than a music project, more an attempt to reconnect with the historical norms by slowly including the different musical techniques that have 
developed since it was devised. It is both a way to communicate with the old music, and pull time through it, grounding new concepts in the ancient practices, and 
through this creating music that is fundamentally new, yet anchored to it's ancestry.
